Whirlwind is a two player game in which the objective is to connect the two ends of the board.

It is played by placing pieces at the intersections of the lines of a square plate of uniform size.

One of the players has black pieces and the other has white pieces. The top and bottom edges of the board are black, while the left and right edges are white, representing the sides of the board that the respective player has to join.
